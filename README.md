# BIO
Let's Get a Job!

For this project, I am looking to begin a continuous and ever evolving site I can utilize to show the growth and potiential I would bring to possible future employers. As I continue to navigate and master the course I will up-date the informatin as well as implement new items and sections to the page.

My intentions will be to (for now) continue to come back to this project at least two or three times a week in order to keep up with the pace of information I am gaining. It is my understanding that the current state of the project only shows a beginning/ working knowledge of HTML and CSS and I need to continue to ensure my BIO continues to grow with me.
