        <h2>Who I am.</h2>
            <p>My name is Raymond Flaherty and I want to showcase to you why I am your best choice for your next hire. As a former Marine and law enforcement professional, I intend to give your company and work environment the best of me every day. I have made a lifetime of being a strong team member and dependable employee under any circumstances. I thrive under pressure and will always look for work or projects to apply myself to. I am excited to join your team and look forward to my first project. </p>

            <h2>What I do.</h2>
            <p>As a graduate of Vanderbilt’s Coding Bootcamp, I am well versed in programming involving html, css, and GIT. I also have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that drives me to improve and hone my skills. I will continue to find new courses and exploit any knowledge I find by adding it to my “tool belt” when I come to work. </p>
